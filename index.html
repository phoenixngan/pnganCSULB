        <p class="lead">Welcome to my Home page. I am a full time student at CSULB. I also graduated from LBCC with an Associated in Computer Science.
             I have been in Long Beach for about 22 years, growing up here ever since I was born. I started out teaching CECS 110 and from that course I developed CECS 200 because of the interest is strictly Web design. The course has been added as part of the requirements for a minor and certificate in Web Technology and Applications along with the CECS 110 course. I completed my Masters degree in Educational Technology in 2006, which I completed completely online.

I am a single mom and have a son who is 22 yrs old and a daughter who is 16. My son is a HB state lifeguard hoping to be a firefighter someday and my daughter is in 11th grade not sure what she wants to do after high school. They both keep me busy along with our 2 dogs and 2 cats</p>
